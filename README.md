# SLOT MACHINE
---
Still trying to figure out how JavaScript works, so decided making a slot machine with 3 slots would be a good way to work with arrays and functions, as well as randomizers. CSS might be a bit messy, and the JavaScript might not be the best, but i managed to figure this out. So im happy with my self for now.
